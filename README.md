# SixDof
Six Degree of Freedom Sim

This sim runs the 6DoF equations of motion in eom.cpp using a driver script, driver.cpp. 

To build it, you need to run "build.sh". 

For convenience, I have included DataReduction.m, which was created and will run on GNU octave. 

All kinematics are defined using quaternions, and support scripts/aero are also included. 

Usage and accesses to this simulation are controlled by Paul D. Zimmer, original creator.  
Private access for now until bugs are worked out.
